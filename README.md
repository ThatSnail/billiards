This is a demonstration of conservative logic with billiard balls, as worked on by Fredkin, Toffoli, Feynman, and others.  This applet shows that conservative logic can represent any classical calculation without increasing entropy (by not erasing any information: see [Landauer's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer's_principle)).
